# About explainers

An explainer is a short description of a process or concept which was initially unclear to our team. Explainers are intended to help new members understand concepts, as well as to jog the memories of existing members.

Explainers do not document decisions; use ADRs for this purpose. Explainers are intended to be higher level than the documentation you might find on a pull request explaining the mechanics of a feature.

## Creating a new explainer

For new explainers, please use [template.md](template.md). The entire length of an explainer should be less than 500 words (roughly a single page).
