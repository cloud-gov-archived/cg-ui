# Roles display strategy

Status: <!-- pick one -->

Draft

## Context and problem statement

We have anecdotal evidence that the various org and space roles that ship with Cloud Foundry can be confusing and it's not always obvious what permissions are associated with each role. Making these roles more generic may also help cloud.gov move away from a more Cloud Foundry-centric ecosystem, to help separate the underlying technoglogy from the customer's experience. 

We need to simplify user and space roles so they are more intuitive and user friendly.

## Decision drivers / forces

The current dashboard, Stratos, was created by the Cloud Foundry community and is tailored specifically to the underlying Cloudy Foundry services. This made it difficult to move in a more general direction, but with our new dashboard being custom built it gives us an opportunity to think about opportunities to simplify roles.
