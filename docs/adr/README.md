# About ADRs

An ADR is an Architectural Decision Record. This log lists the architectural decisions for the cloud.gov dashboard rebuild.

## Creating a new ADR

For new ADRs, please use [template.md](template.md).

## ADR review process

Since ADRs are meant to codify architectural decisions which will affect the entire platform and team, they should ideally be reviewed and approved by multiple team members. Since ADRs are often dense, they are usually better explained and understood in a group discussion than individual PR reviews. Furthermore, having multiple team members discuss an ADR increases the chances of identifying problems with the proposal.

Once a PR is created for an ADR, the ADR author should schedule a team meeting. In order for the meeting to proceed, a quorum of **3 team members is required**.

If 3 team members do not accept the invite, then try **re-scheduling the meeting one time**. If quorum cannot be met for the re-scheduled meeting, then the ADR review process can be handled by individual reviews on the PR.
